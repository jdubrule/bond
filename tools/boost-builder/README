This directory contains the source for a docker container that will create
binaries of a number of boost versions for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). These
binaries are useful for regression testing across those boost releases.

To create the binaries, start in the directory containing this README.

Make the docker image:
$ docker build -t boost-builder .

Run the image:
$ docker run -v `pwd`/out:/boosts -t boost-builder

The build takes about fifteen minutes on a quad-core 3.3 GHz Xeon. When it
finishes, there will be a set of .tar.xz archives in out/. Each archive is
meant to be unzipped from your root directory and will put, e.g., boost 1.63.0
in /opt/boost_1_63_0. Multiple archives can be safely extracted into one
filesystem.

To make the binaries available for the existing travis setup, see
upload_boosts.zsh in this directory.
